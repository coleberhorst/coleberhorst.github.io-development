> But, after taking expert advice from one another, the committee members managed to solve the mystery. The problem was, of course, wolves. Although they have lived with caribou for thousands of years, and though caribou seldom feature in their diet,4 wolves have suddenly become an urgent threat to the survival of the species, just as seals suddenly became cod’s nemesis in the 1980s. The committee explained the nature of the problem to the government, which has responded by intensifying its poisoning and shooting of wolves, in order, of course, to protect the natural world.

You can see this change manifested in the sharp decline of mountain caribou in British Columbia, caused primarily by logging;5

An ounce of hope is a more powerful stimulant than a ton of despair. The positive environmentalism I develop in Feral is intended to create a vision of a better place, which we can keep in mind even as we seek to prevent our governments from engineering a worse one.

> We had watched the miners tearing out the veins of the forest: the river valleys whose sediments were paved with gold. We had seen evidence of the one-sided war some of them were waging against the local Yanomami people, and the physical and cultural collapse of the communities they had invaded. We had heard the gunfire that came from the woods every night, as bandits waylaid the miners, thieves were executed, or men who had struck lucky fought over the gold they had found. In the six months since the main rush began here, 1,700 of the 40,000 miners had been shot dead. Fifteen per cent of the Yanomami had died of disease.

> J. G. Ballard reminded us that ‘the suburbs dream of violence. Asleep in their drowsy villas, sheltered by benevolent shopping malls, they wait patiently for the nightmares that will wake them into a more passionate world.’1 We still possess the fear, the courage, the aggression which evolved to see us through our quests and crises, and we still feel the need to exercise them. But our sublimated lives oblige us to invent challenges to replace the horrors of which we have been deprived. We find ourselves hedged by the consequences of our nature, living meekly for fear of provoking or damaging others. ‘Thus conscience does make cowards of us all.’2

> Three days before I arrived in the manyatta, he had run thirty miles to visit a friend. As he approached the friend’s village, he met the girl walking up the track, and changed his plans. They spent the day together, and by nightfall he had persuaded her to elope with him. They waited until everyone in her village was asleep, then slipped out of the compound and ran. The dogs woke, and her brothers set off in pursuit. The two lovers darted through the scrub, but soon after midnight the brothers surrounded them. The girl refused to go home. She told her brothers that if they wanted to talk to her they would have to come to Toronkei’s village. The brothers returned to their compound, and Toronkei and his fiancée reached his manyatta just before dawn. Her father was furious, but there was little he could do: his daughter would not be dissuaded. Toronkei had opened negotiations: the father had demanded a bride price of five cows and 10,000 shillings. Toronkei’s parents were trying to talk him down. The girl came from a rich family, and the deal would be tough. Hearing this story, watching the proud, conspiratorial looks he exchanged with his bride, seeing the hero’s treatment he now received

I sat in the hut drinking milk and greeting the procession of young men who came in to pay their respects to him, troubled by a sense of inadequacy. As I watched the warriors sitting hand in hand on the pallet, and the young woman looking tenderly at her husband, I was struck by a thought so clear and resonant that it was as if a bell had been rung beside my ear. Had I, as an embryo, been given a choice between my life and his–knowing that, whichever I accepted, I would adapt to it and make myself comfortable within it–I would have taken his.

> In 1753, Benjamin Franklin, writing to the English botanist Peter Collinson, made the following complaint: When an Indian Child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our Customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian Ramble with them, there is no perswading him ever to return, and that this is not natural to them merely as Indians, but as men, is plain from this, that when white persons of either sex have been taken prisoners young by the Indians, and lived a while among them, tho’ ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our manner of life, and the care and pains that are necessary to support it, and take the first good Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them.1

> Elopement with indigenous peoples was seen by the colonial authorities as a major threat to their attempts to subjugate the New World. When, in 1612, young men started defecting from Jamestown, the first sustained English settlement in North America, the deputy governor, Thomas Dale, hunted them down. According to a contemporary account, Some he apointed to be hanged. Some burned. Some to be broken upon wheles, others to be staked and some to be shott to death.2 The severity of these sanctions hints at the strength of the attraction. Despite the penalties, Europeans continued to defect, or to remain with the indigenous peoples who had captured them in war, until the Native Americans had been so reduced and broken that there was no longer a life to be drawn to. In 1785, Hector de Crèvecoeur remarked upon the fierce determination of European children to stay with the Indian communities that had kidnapped them, when their parents came to collect them during periods of peace. . . . those whose more advanced ages permitted them to recollect their fathers and mothers, absolutely refused to follow them, and ran to their adopted parents for protection against the effusions of love their unhappy real parents lavished on them! Incredible as this may appear, I have heard it asserted in a thousand instances, among persons of credit. In the village of -------, where I purpose to go, there lived, about fifteen years ago, an Englishman and a Swede . . . They were grown to the age of men when they were taken; they happily escaped the great punishment of war captives, and were obliged to marry the Squaws who had saved their lives by adoption. By the force of habit, they became at last thoroughly naturalised to this wild course of life. While I was there, their friends sent them a considerable sum of money to ransom themselves with. The Indians, their old masters, gave them their choice . . . They chose to remain; and the reasons they gave me would greatly surprise you: the most perfect freedom, the ease of living, the absence of those cares and corroding solicitudes which so often prevail with us . . . thousands of Europeans are Indians, and we have no examples of even one of these Aborigines having from choice become Europeans!3

At any one moment, your eyes and brain only have the processing power to look at a very small part of your surroundings . . . to help ensure that precious time and energy aren’t wasted on trivial details, your brain quickly identifies what it considers to be the most significant aspects of your surroundings, and focuses almost all of its attention on these elements.15

> Certain paranormal phenomena afflict every society, and these phenomena appear to reflect our desires; desires of which we may not be fully conscious. In Victorian Britain, large numbers of people believed that the dead were appearing to them and communicating with them. They saw ghosts, heard voices and imagined they could exchange messages with the departed through séances and table-turning. The Victorians were obsessed by death. Walk around any ancient graveyard and you will read the tragic story of that era: children and spouses snatched away, sometimes, in the epidemics that raged through the crowded cities, within days of each other. Ours was a nation in perpetual mourning. The notion that the dead could return in this life must have been almost as comforting as the belief that we would be reunited with them in the afterlife. Today reports of contact with the dead are less prevalent. As the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union gripped the world’s imagination, sightings of UFOs and aliens, almost unknown in previous eras, multiplied.

> Could it be that illusory big cats also answer an unmet need? As our lives have become tamer and more predictable, as the abundance and diversity of nature have declined, as our physical challenges have diminished to the point at which the greatest trial of strength and ingenuity we face is opening a badly designed packet of nuts, could these imaginary creatures have brought us something we miss? Perhaps the beasts many people now believe are lurking in the dark corners of the land inject into our lives a thrill that can otherwise be delivered only by artificial means. Perhaps they reawaken old genetic memories of conflict and survival, memories which must incorporate encounters–possibly the most challenging encounters our ancestors faced–with large predatory cats. They hint at an unexpressed wish for lives wilder and fiercer than those we now lead. Our desires stare back at us, yellow-eyed and snarling, from the thickets of the mind.

> The beaver is one of several missing animals that have been described as keystone species. A keystone species is one that has a larger impact on its environment than its numbers alone would suggest. This impact creates the conditions which allow other species to live there. European beavers, unlike the North American species, build only small dams, but the changes they make to the flow of rivers, the branches and twigs they drag into the water, the burrows they excavate, the shallow ditches they create as they forage on the land and their felling of some of the riverside trees transforms their surroundings. They create habitats for water voles, otters, ducks, frogs, fish and insects. In Wyoming, where admittedly the ponds they make are larger than those in Europe, streams where beavers live harbour seventy-five times as many waterbirds as those without.20

> Our rivers, like the land, have suffered from intensive management. They have been straightened and canalized, dredged and cleared.

Restoring trophic diversity means enhancing the number of opportunities for animals, plants and other creatures to feed on each other; to rebuild the broken strands in the web of life.

> One of the most fascinating discoveries in modern ecology is an abundance of trophic cascades. A trophic cascade occurs when the animals at the top of the food chain–the top predators–change the numbers not just of their prey, but also of species with which they have no direct connection. Their impacts cascade down the food chain, in some cases radically changing the ecosystem, the landscape and even the chemical composition of the soil and the atmosphere. The best-known example is the dramatic change that followed the reintroduction of wolves to the Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Seventy years after they had been exterminated, wolves were released into the park in 1995. When they arrived, many of the streamsides and riversides were almost bare, closely cropped by the high population of red deer (which in North America, confusingly, are called elk*5). But as soon as the wolves arrived, this began to change. It was not just that they sharply reduced the number of deer, but they also altered their prey’s behaviour. The deer avoided the places–particularly the valleys and gorges–where they could be caught most easily.32 In some places, trees on the riverbanks, until then constantly suppressed by browsing, quintupled in height in just six years.33 The trees shaded and cooled the water and provided cover for fish and other animals,34 changing the wildlife…

Among them was a spiny anteater the size of a pig; a giant herbivore a bit like a wombat, which weighed two tonnes; a marsupial tapir as big as a horse; a ten-foot kangaroo; a marsupial lion with opposable thumbs and a stronger bite than any other known mammal, which could prop itself up on its tail in order to stand on its hindlegs and slash with its tremendous claws; a horned tortoise eight feet long; a monitor lizard much bigger than the Nile crocodile. Most of these species, alongside many other marvellous beasts, disappeared between 40,000 and 50,000 years ago. At roughly the same time, the dense rainforests which covered much of that continent began to be replaced with the grass and scrubby trees which populate much of the outback today.

Page: 89
> Trophic cascades might once have dominated most ecosystems. The old belief among ecologists that natural systems were controlled only from the bottom up–that the abundance of plants controls the abundance of plant eaters, which controls the abundance of meat eaters–arose from the fact that many of the systems they were studying had already been greatly changed by people, not least through the reduction or extinction of top predators. Much of the richness and complexity–the trophic diversity–of these foodwebs was lost before it was recorded. We live in a shadowland, a dim, flattened relic of what there once was, of what there could be again.

> We associate elephants, rhinos, lions and hyenas with the tropics. But until very recently (in geological terms) they lived in climates much colder than north-western Europe is today. Until around 40,000 years ago, the straight-tusked elephant (Elephas antiquus), closely related to the Asian elephant, roamed across much of Europe.1 The woolly mammoth, which had an entirely different ecology, grazing on cold steppes (rather than browsing, like the straight-tusked elephant, in temperate forests) lasted longer: one relict population, isolated from human hunters in the fastness of Wrangel Island off the north coast of Siberia, survived until the Bronze Age.2 Three species of rhinoceros–the woolly, the Merck’s and the narrow-nosed–lived in Europe at the same time as humans. Until roughly 40,000 years ago, Russia was haunted by two monstrous beasts, Elasmotherium sibiricum and Elasmotherium caucasicum. They were humpbacked rhinos the size of elephants, eight feet to the crest, weighing perhaps five tonnes. Elephants roamed across Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas; rhinos never populated the Americas, but they lived throughout the Old World. Across the past 50,000 years the range and variety of these species have shrunk as humans have hunted them. They were exterminated first in Europe; then (in the case of elephants) in the Americas; then in the Middle East and North Africa; then in most of Asia; eventually in most of Africa. The animals conservationists are now desperately trying–and often failing–to save are the last, tiny populations of creatures which once dominated most of the earth’s surface, so recently that we can almost stretch out our fingers and touch them. When Trafalgar Square was excavated in the nineteenth century, presumably to build Nelson’s column, the river gravels the builders exposed were found to be crammed with…

> I will not try to disguise my reasons for wanting to see missing animals reintroduced. It is not, as the previous chapter might have suggested, the desire to control floods, or reduce erosion or hinder the spread of disease, though all these might be useful side-effects. My reasons arise from my delight in the marvels of nature, its richness and its limitless capacity to surprise; from the sense of freedom, of the thrill that comes from roaming in a landscape or seascape without knowing what I might see next, what might loom from the woods or water, what might be watching me without my knowledge. It is the sense that without these animals the ecosystem is lopsided, abridged, dysfunctional. I can produce reasons scientific, economic, historic and hygienic, but none of those describe my motivation.

Until very recently, large animals lived almost everywhere, often in great numbers.

The Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci used the term ‘cultural hegemony’ to describe the way in which ideas and concepts which benefit a dominant class are universalized. They become norms, adopted whole and unexamined, which shape our thinking. Perhaps we suffer from agricultural hegemony: what is deemed to be good for farmers or landowners is deemed, without question or challenge, to be good for everyone.

In just sixty years, the greatly increased flocks in most of the upland areas of Britain completed the transformation: turning heath and prairie into something resembling a bowling green with contours.

Just over three-quarters of the area of Wales is devoted to livestock farming,*1 largely to produce meat.†2 But, by value, Wales imports seven times as much meat as it exports.18 This remarkable fact suggests an astonishing failure of productivity.

> That is not quite the end of the issue. Deep vegetation on the hills absorbs rain when it falls, and releases it gradually, delivering a steady supply of water to the lowlands. When trees and shrubs are removed, the rain flashes off the hills, causing floods downstream. Sheep also compact the topsoil, reducing its permeability, which ensures that still less water is absorbed. Drainage systems dug in the pastures accelerate these effects. When the floods abate, water levels fall rapidly. Upland grazing contributes to a cycle of flood and drought.

> I was keen to discover why the Forestry Commission in Wales, a branch of the Welsh government, had issued a blanket ban on tree planting grants across almost all the uplands.*6 The explanation she gave astonished me: she claimed that allowing trees to return to the uplands would exacerbate global warming, as carbon dioxide would be released from the soil. When I asked her officials how this statement could be justified, they sent me two long scientific reports. I read them and discovered that they said the opposite of what the minister and her department had claimed. One of them revealed that it is not tree planting but overgrazing by sheep which has reduced the amount of carbon in the soil in the Welsh uplands.†7 Even plantation forestry, which creates much greater disturbance of the soil than allowing native trees to spread, causes no demonstrable carbon loss.42 The other told me that in all the situations it modelled, planting trees on grasslands increased the amount of carbon in the soil.43

> ‘Our knowledge was not valued,’ Delyth went on. ‘The story was that people who stayed on the farms were the dimmest of all–so their knowledge must be dim as well. No one thought of writing it down. My father hardly wrote. He had to remember all the sheep figures, the prices and everything. There’s not the same need to use our brains now.’ Dafydd was teaching himself the old Welsh counting system. Based on multiples of 10, 15 and 20, it was designed by shepherds for counting animals. ‘You can juggle the numbers between the fingers of your two hands, totting the blocks on one, the individuals on the other. It allows you to count very quickly. In the new numbers, you can’t count fast enough to match the speed that sheep run at. So you have to slow them down through the gate. From the 1970s onwards, Welsh learners were taught the decimal system. I can see the sense in that, but we’ve also lost something.’ He could, Delyth told me, judge the weight of a sheep to within a kilo; they had stopped using the scales as he always got it right, and it was quicker to weigh them by eye. She could do something he could not: she could spot their diseases at a distance, diagnosing them from the way the sheep stand or lie. She also knows just when they are going to lamb.

We don’t know what North America would have looked like with no humans at all, but we do know it didn’t look like that under the ‘Indians’. Bone excavations show that passenger pigeons were not even common in the 1400s. ‘Indians’ specifically targeted pregnant deer and wild turkeys before they laid eggs, to eliminate competition for maize and tree nuts. They routinely burned forests to keep them convenient for human use. And they kept salmon and shellfish populations down by eating them, and thereby suppressed populations of other creatures that ate them. When human populations crashed, nonhuman populations exploded.11

Though Yellowstone’s champions, such as Thomas Meagher, Cornelius Hedges and Ferdinand Hayden, were motivated by their love for the land, the proposal was to a large extent driven and financed by Jay Cooke, owner of the Northern Pacific Railroad.18 He hoped that the tourist trade would boost his railway’s income. (Cooke failed to benefit from its establishment in 1872, however, as his company collapsed in 1873.) The act which created the park states that the land is hereby reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale under the laws of the United States . . . and all persons who shall locate, or settle upon, or occupy the same or any part therof, except as hereinafter provided, shall be considered trespassers and removed therefrom.19 The provision was necessary to preserve the character of the land from encroachment by European Americans, at a time in which the West was being rapidly transformed. But Congress overlooked the fact that it had been settled for some 11,000 years, and appears still to have been used by the Crow, the Shoshone Tukadika and the Blackfoot.*6 They too were transformed into trespassers in the park and were eventually removed therefrom. The act preserving Yellowstone–and its clearance of native people–became the model for the creation of national parks throughout the Union, and in many other parts of the world.

> Lorenz sought scientific justifications for Friedrich Nietzsche’s attempt to equate the civilization of humans with the domestication of animals. In both cases, Lorenz claimed, the result was genetic decline and the disruption of what Nietzsche celebrated as instinctive behaviour, leading to social breakdown, degeneracy, indiscriminate breeding, a lack of patriotic enthusiasm and eventual human extinction. He appeared to endorse the view of the ancient Greeks that, as he put it, ‘a handsome man can never be bad and an ugly man can never be good’.22 He listed the physical characteristics which he said were caused by both human civilization and the domestication of animals–rounded heads, shortened limbs, pot bellies–which happened to correspond with popular Nazi stereotypes of Jewish physiognomy. He coined a term for this supposed transformation: Verhausschweinung, or pig domestication.

As I turned the bone over in my hands, feeling its weight, feeling the years fall away, feeling myself, in that cave of Bronze Age junk, fall with them, I experienced what seemed like an electric jolt. The great weight of the bone, the knowledge of what it was, the sense–so clean and new it seemed–that the beast whose head it bore might have been hunted and slaughtered not 3,000 years ago but so recently that I could almost reach out and place my palm on the sweat and hair of its cooling flank ran through my arms and fulminated in my head, almost with a flash of light. It might have been at this point that the imaginative journey began which, many years later, led to this book. The brothers Ludwig and Heinz Heck, respectively the directors of the Berlin and Munich zoos during the period of Nazi rule–a time in which zookeeping was a political activity–were not content with reconstructing the aurochs in their minds. They wanted to create a real one.34 Like the scientists in Jurassic Park, they sought to resurrect this animal, as well as the ancestral horse, from genetic material; but in this case the material carried by the wild animal’s descendants. As Konrad Lorenz hoped to do with human beings, they tried to strip cattle of their domestic traits so that the purified, uncivilized beast within could break, pawing and roaring, out of its degenerate husk. As was so often the case with the declarations the Nazis made, the success the Heck brothers claimed for their attempts at genetic reversal was exaggerated. They maintained that, in the space of just twelve years, they had re-created the aurochs. All they did, in reality, was to produce a cow whose coat roughly resembled that of its wild ancestor, but which was a good deal smaller, had different proportions and would not breed true.

The plan points out that ‘the site is artificial, having been created as the result of human activity following the removal of trees during the manufacture of lead’. It was kept treeless, before it became a nature reserve, by the farmers who burnt and grazed it.

As whale numbers have declined, so have the krill:13 to just one-fifth of their volume before the 1980s.14 Their collapse, until recently, mystified observers. It now seems that the whales perform an essential role in keeping nutrients in the surface waters. If undisturbed, the plant plankton at the bottom of the foodchain sinks out of sight, beyond the photic zone (the waters in which the light is strong enough to permit plants to grow).

> There is one sure means by which the ecology of the seas can be protected and restored. That is the creation of marine reserves in which no fishing or other industry takes place, and in which both mobile and sessile lifeforms are allowed to recover. In other words, rewilding. In 2002, at two world summits, governments promised to protect at least 10 per cent of the world’s seas by 2012.55 In 2003 the World Parks Congress called for at least 20 or 30 per cent of every habitat at sea to become strict reserves by the same date.56 Despite the creation of a few very large conservation areas, such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, covering 350,000 square kilometres, at the time of writing less than 2 per cent of the world’s seas has any form of protection,57 and only in some of these places is fishing wholly excluded.

> Like the Kraken in Tennyson’s poem, the suppressed life of the sea awaits only its chance to re-emerge. Not all missing populations can be restored. Some of the lifeforms being wrecked by perhaps the most destructive fishing operation of all–the trawling of the deep seamounts–take thousands of years to grow.

> There should also be restrictions on the kind of equipment used in places where fishing continues, on the capacity of fishing boats and the time they spend at sea and on their freedom to discard the fish they do not want to keep.

> Fishermen tend to resist marine reserves before they are created, then to support them once they have been established, as their catches rise, often far beyond expectations. In the seas surrounding the Apo reserve that I mentioned a moment ago, for example, the catch swiftly rose to ten times its previous level, and has stayed that way since.67 There have been similar results in, for example, fisheries off Japan, New Zealand, Newfoundland and Kenya.68

> Marine protection is so cheap and the results so lucrative that, the Royal Commission calculated, just a 2 or 3 per cent increase in the fish catch in the North Sea would pay for the protection of 30 per cent of its area.69 The returns are more likely to rise by 200 or 300 per cent.

> A report by the New Economics Foundation suggests that the failure to protect fish stocks properly costs the European Union some 82,000 jobs and €3 billion a year.70 Marine rewilding not only offers the best chance of protecting much of the life of the seas, but also the best chance of protecting the livelihoods of those who harvest it. The weight of fish landed worldwide peaked in 1988. Despite attempts by Chinese officials to inflate their production figures, it has been declining since then by half a million tonnes a year.71 The surest means by which this could be reversed is the creation of a network of large marine reserves.

> There is one method–scallop dredging–that is restricted in some parts of the Special Area of Conservation. With the possible exception of dynamite fishing, it would be hard to devise a more effective means of destroying both living creatures and their habitats. Scallop dredges operate by raking through the seabed with long metal teeth, dislodging the shellfish from the sediments and trapping them in a net whose underside is made of chain mail. The teeth rip through any sedentary creature in their path, as well as the fish, crabs and lobsters unable to escape in time.

> By seeking out the pockets of land and water that might inspire and guide an attempt to revive the natural world, I had revived my own life. Long before my dreams of restoration had been realized, the untamed spirit I had sought to invoke had already returned. By equipping myself with knowledge of the past while imagining a rawer and richer future, I had banished my ecological boredom.

> Had the sun not been shining, had the sky and waves been cut from slate, not crystal, the sea that now looked inviting to me would have appeared forbidding, perhaps terrifying. But we are simple creatures, and a sprinkling of stardust dazzles our senses. Had the quest not been so arousing, had the ride been any less thrilling, I might have challenged the grounds on which I continued to head out to sea. This is a roundabout way of telling you that I failed to notice that a journey which had begun foolishly was now progressing towards madness:

> The mountain appeared to snag the star then to drag it down into the earth like an ant lion. A puff of indigo cloud, like cannon smoke, hung against a sheet of flaming cirrus. I looked around the bay. Though the light was fading, I could see the whole crescent. To the south was the gently rising plateau of the Cambrian Desert, dissolving into the suggestion of Pembrokeshire, where a few lights now glimmered.

> I would question the idea that Lawrence invites us to discard rationality, on the grounds that we do not have a great deal to discard (as the work of researchers such as Jonathan Haidt and Antonio Damasio shows). What he invites us to discard, and what I think Eagleton and Bertrand Russell are talking about, is universalism. If blood and culture are allowed to outweigh the consistent application of universalist principles (in particular the golden rule), this can become a licence to trample on other people.
