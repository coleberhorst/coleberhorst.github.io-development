> grandfather was right: Money isn’t everything. The bottom line: Money can’t make you happy if your increased wealth brings increased expectations.

> Kurt Vonnegut used to recount a conversation he had with fellow author Joseph Heller (Vonnegut published this anecdote as a poem in the New Yorker). The two writers were at a party thrown by a billionaire when Vonnegut joked, “How does it feel to know that our host makes more in one day than Catch-22 [Heller’s best-known work] has made in its entire history?” Heller responded, “I’ve got something he can never have. I’ve got Enough.”

> Ramit Sethi popularized the concept of conscious spending in his book I Will Teach You to Be Rich (Workman Publishing, 2009). The idea is to spend with intent, deliberately deciding where to direct your money instead of spending impulsively. Sethi argues that it’s okay to spend $5,000 a year on shoes — if that spending is aligned with your goals and values and you’ve made a conscious choice to spend this way (as opposed to spending compulsively — see Curbing Compulsive Spending).
                

Page: 15
> If you’re new to conscious spending, try asking yourself the following questions: Did I receive value from this equal to the amount I spent? In other words, did you get your money’s worth? You already know that $100 spent on one thing isn’t always as good as $100 spent on another. Conscious spending is about striving to get the most bang for your buck. Is this spending aligned with my goals and values? Conscious spending means prioritizing: putting your money toward the things you love — and cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don’t. If you’re happy with the coffee at the office, then don’t waste your money at Starbucks. But if your extra-hot nonfat caramel latte is the highlight of your day, then buy the latte! Spend only on the things that matter to you.

> Once you define Enough, you gain a sense of freedom. You’re no longer caught up in the rat race and have time to pursue your passions. You can surround yourself with family and friends, and rediscover the importance of social capital — the value you get from making personal connections with people in your community (see Social Capital). And because you no longer feel compelled to buy more Stuff, you can use your money to save for things that truly matter.

> Psychologists generally agree that a life well-lived is rich in: Security. It’s hard to be happy when you’re constantly worrying about how to pay the bills. If you have money, you don’t have to worry about those things. (But, as you now know, you don’t have to be rich to be happy.) By living below your means and avoiding debt, you can gain some financial control over your life. Relationships. True wealth comes from relationships, not from dollars and cents. Wealthy or poor, people with five or more close friends are more apt to describe themselves as happy than those with fewer. A long-term, loving partnership goes hand in hand with this. And as you’ll learn later (Social Capital), social capital can be worth as much as financial capital. Experiences. As explained in the Note on How Money Affects Happiness, memories tend to grow more positive with time, but Stuff usually drops in value — both actual value and perceived value. As Gregory Karp writes in The 1-2-3 Money Plan (FT Press, 2009), “Experiences appreciate, assets depreciate.” And in Your Money and Your Brain (Simon & Schuster, 2008), Jason Zweig notes, “Doing and being are better than having.”

> Prioritize. Spend on the things that make you happiest. There’s nothing wrong with buying things you’ll use and enjoy — that’s the purpose of money. If you’re spending less than you earn, meeting your needs, and saving for the future, you can afford things that make life easier and more enjoyable. (For another way to prioritize, see the box on Living a Rich Life.) Stay healthy. There’s a strong tie between health and happiness. Anyone who’s experienced a prolonged injury or illness knows just how emotionally — and financially — devastating it can be. Eat right, exercise, and get enough sleep (Your Body: The Missing Manual has loads of tips on how to do all those things). Don’t compare yourself to others. Financially, psychologically, and socially, keeping up with the Joneses is a trap. You’ll always have friends who are wealthier and more successful in their careers than you. Focus on your own life and goals. Limit media exposure. Mass media — especially TV — tries to persuade you that happiness depends on things you don’t really need and can’t afford. Studies have found that watching lots of TV can influence your levels of materialism — how much you think you need to be happy. Simplify. The average Joe believes that materialism is the path to happiness — but the average Joe is wrong. Research shows that materialism actually leads to unhappiness and dissatisfaction. By simplifying your life and reducing the amount of Stuff you own (or want to own), you’ll save money and be happier. Help others. Altruism is one of the best ways to boost your happiness. It may seem counter-intuitive (and maybe even a little self-serving), but donating to your church or favorite charity is a proven method for brightening your day. Embrace routine. Emerson wrote, “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds,” but there’s evidence that some consistency is conducive to contentment. In Happier (McGraw-Hill, 2007), Tal Ben-Shahar recommends building routines around the things you love: reading, walking, gaming, knitting, whatever. Because it can be difficult to make the time for these activities, he argues that we should make rituals out of them. If you enjoy biking, make a ritual out of riding to the park every evening, for example. (See the box below for tips on finding time for what you love.) Pursue meaningful goals. As you’ll learn in the next chapter, the road to wealth is paved with goals, and the same is true of the road to happiness. But for a goal to be worthwhile, it has to be related to your values and interests — it has to add something

> Imagine you have an empty jar, a collection of a few large rocks, and several handfuls of gravel. Your task is to put all the large and small rocks into the jar. One approach would be to pile all the gravel first, but doing so would leave room for only one or two of the large rocks; you wouldn’t get everything to fit. Switch your approach and put the large rocks in first, and you’ll find that the gravel will all fit nicely around the empty space. If a bit of gravel doesn’t fit at the end, you’ve not lost much. Let too many little things take priority, and there never seems to be time for the big things. Consider the Big Rocks to be really important things you want to accomplish in life, the things that define you. Get the big things in first, work on the right projects and priorities, and let the little stuff fit in around the edges. Let your Big Rocks be non-negotiable priorities in your weekly calendar — and learn to say “no” when other things begin to intrude. Then fit those other things in where you can.

> With goals come tradeoffs, but having goals makes those tradeoffs easier to bear. If you’re saving 25% of your take-home pay so you can quit your crummy job and start your own business, it’s easier to pass up a ski weekend with friends because you know doing so will help you reach your goal that much sooner.
                

Page: 27
> Positive. Positive goals (where you’re attempting to reach a target, like saving for a vacation) yield better results than negative goals (where you’re trying to avoid something, like cutting out your daily latte). Flexible. Your goals will evolve over time. As your priorities change, your goals should, too. This isn’t an excuse to abandon a difficult goal or to quit just because you failed to meet it. But if you lose your job, say, you need to be willing to adapt your goals to take your new circumstances into account. Activity-oriented. Goals that involve doing rather than getting make people happier. Pursuing experiential goals will bring you more fulfillment than obtaining more Stuff.
                

Page: 28
> One way to multitask without becoming overwhelmed is to work on one short-term goal, one mid-term goal, and one long-term goal at the same time. If your long-term goal is to save for a down payment on a house, for example, you might also have a mid-term goal of saving for a holiday in Hawaii, and a short-term goal of asking your boss for a raise.

> Find out exactly how much the item costs. Designate an envelope for saving the money, and write your target sum on the outside. Find a picture of the item in a magazine or online, or take the photo yourself. Fasten the picture to the envelope. Commit to a definite schedule for adding money to the envelope — $10 a week, say, or $50 every paycheck. Write that commitment on the envelope, too. Feed the envelope according to your schedule. Each time you add money to the envelope, you’ll see the picture of the item you want, setting up a positive feedback loop that feeds your desire. To supercharge this technique, Brem suggests Photoshoping a picture of yourself with the thing you’re saving for so that it reinforces the positive buzz. (You can also use this method with targeted savings accounts, which are described on Targeted Savings Accounts.)

> Internal trolls are more insidious than their external cousins because they’re part of you, so eradicating them requires self-discipline. Internal trolls include: Self-defeating thoughts and behaviors: “I can’t do this — it’s too difficult”, “I’m not smart enough”, “It’s too much work”, “I don’t deserve to have money.” Procrastination: “I’ll start next week”, “I’ll worry about this later”, “I can start saving next month.” For more on how to beat the procrastination habit, see http://tinyurl.com/GRS-putoff. Rationalization: “Buying just one pair of shoes won’t blow my budget”, “I’m out with my friends — I should have fun”, “I deserve to reward myself for how well I’ve been doing lately.” Barriers: “I don’t know how to open a Roth IRA”, “It’s too much bother to set up automatic deposits”, “Sure I could shop around for lower rates, but I don’t like talking on the phone.” (There’s more on how to knock down the barriers that hold you back at http://tinyurl.com/GRS-barriers.) Most internal trolls are a product of self-doubt and can be best combated through exercise, discipline, positive social interaction, and a healthy diet. (Yes, exercise and a healthy diet can help you with your finances!)

> Allocate no more than 50% to needs, including housing, transportation, groceries, insurance, and a basic wardrobe. Spend up to 30% on wants like cable TV, clothing beyond the basics, dining out, concert tickets, comic books, knitting supplies, and so on. Set aside at least 20% for savings, including paying off debt.
                

Page: 41
> 60% to committed expenses like taxes, clothing, basic living expenses, insurance, charity (including tithing), and regular bills (like cable). 10% to short-term savings for things like vacations, home repairs, new appliances, and so on. 10% to long-term savings including car purchases, home renovations, emergency savings, and paying down debt. 10% to retirement savings through Roth IRAs, 401(k)s, and the like. 10% for fun money you can spend on anything you want: hobbies, dining out, whatever.

> Yearly budgets are more accurate because people consider more expense categories when thinking long-term. If you build a monthly budget in April, for example, will you remember to include a category for Christmas gifts?

> In The Paradox of Choice (Harper, 2005), Barry Schwartz describes his research on two groups of people that he calls Maximizers and Satisficers: Maximizers only accept the best. Every time they make a purchase (or do anything else), they need to be sure they’ve made the best possible decision. Satisficers are willing to settle for “good enough.” These people still have expectations and standards, but they’re willing to settle for something other than the absolute best in order to save time, money, or effort.

> have. “Overspenders…have confused and confusing relationships with money,” write psychologists Brad and Ted Klontz in Mind Over Money (Broadway, 2009). “On one hand, they’re convinced that money and the things it can buy will make them happy; yet they’re often broke because they can’t control their spending.”

> One reader at Get Rich Slowly sits down once a year to call all of his service providers to ask if he can save money. He simply calls the customer service line and asks about specials and promotions. This only takes a few minutes, but yields repeated savings.

> Choose a store and learn its prices. Because supermarkets monkey with prices, you can’t be sure a deal is really a deal unless you know what the store usually charges. Use a price book (see the box on the next page) to uncover regular and sale prices. Once you know one store’s prices, you can save even more by learning another store’s prices and comparing them to the first store’s.

> Discard brand loyalties. You may have a favorite brand of diced tomatoes, but does it really matter? Buy whatever has the lowest unit price, even if that means getting the store brand or a generic. You may find you like the less-expensive product just as well. (The box on Supermarket savings has more on generics.)

> Buy from produce stands and farmers markets. During the summer months, produce stands and farmers markets offer fresh, local food at excellent prices. Even better, these kinds of places usually don’t have a lot of impulse items to tempt you. Also look at community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs, which let you “subscribe” to fresh produce from a local farm (see www.localharvest.org for more info).
                

Page: 80
> Waste not. One of the best ways to save money on food is to not let it go to waste. According to various estimates, Americans throw away 12–25% of their food. So if you spend $400 on groceries every month, you may be able to save $50 to $100 simply by never throwing food away. (Here’s a New York Times article on the subject: http://tinyurl.com/fwaste.)
                

Page: 81
> If your family throws away a lot of spoiled food, create a leftover list and post it on the fridge. Every time you store leftovers, note the date, the name of the dish, and how many servings are left. When you’re hungry, check the list!
                

Page: 82
> Eat a healthy snack before you go. Grab a banana or some carrot sticks to take the edge off your hunger so you won’t be tempted to order too much when you look at the menu. Order appetizers as your meal. At many eateries, appetizers are a cheap and tasty alternative to ordering a main dish, and they’re often plenty big to fill you up. Share food. Portion sizes in American restaurants have grown enormous over the past few decades, so try splitting an entrée. Many restaurants charge a few bucks extra for this, but it’s much less than paying for a second main dish.

> Because heating and cooling use the most energy, they also offer the best opportunities for saving. Bluejay estimates that the typical family can save about: $1,200 a year by using space heaters instead of central heating. (And you can save even more with a heat pump — after you recoup the installation costs.) $600 a year by using fans instead of AC. $150 a year by drying clothes on a line instead of in a dryer. $150 a year by washing laundry in cold water instead of hot. $100 a year by replacing regular light bulbs with compact fluorescents. $75 a year by getting rid of your TV. $60 a year by putting your computer in sleep mode when you’re not using it.

The government estimates the average homeowner could save $180 per year by installing an Energy Star programmable thermostat (see http://tinyurl.com/ES-thermostat).

> Shop with a purpose. The key to keeping your shopping under control is to buy only what you need. It may help you to shop with a list, just like at the grocery store. Knowing exactly why you’re shopping can help keep you from getting distracted.

> Here are Chapman’s five rules for negotiating your salary when interviewing for a job: Postpone salary negotiations until you’re offered the job. Let your potential employer decide whether you’re the right candidate, and then talk about money. The same is true of raises — discuss them after you have your performance review. (The next section has more about asking for a raise.) Let them go first. It’s hard to come out ahead by naming a number, so let your employer suggest a salary. Lots of people find it awkward to evade direct questions about salary history. For these folks, Chapman has posted a short video that explains how to answer questions about salary expectations: http://salarynegotiations.com/Video.htm. (Also see Penelope Trunk’s advice on the subject: http://tinyurl.com/BCsalary.) When you hear their offer, repeat the top value — and then stop talking. “The most likely outcome of this silence is a raise,” Chapman writes. This technique buys you some time to think while putting pressure on the employer. For more on this step, check out Chapman’s video about it: http://tinyurl.com/theflinch. Counter their offer with a researched response. Next, make a counter-offer based on what you know about yourself, the market, and the company. This means you have to do some research beforehand so you know the reasonable salary range for the position. Clinch the deal — then deal some more. Finally, lock in the offer, and then negotiate additional benefits like extra vacation days or a company car. This is like agreeing on the price of a car before you negotiate the value of your trade-in (see Sell your old car separately).
                

Page: 107
> Make your case. Draw up a list of ways you’ve helped the company, and try to state these achievements in dollar terms, if you can. For example: “By creating the new maintenance schedule for our delivery trucks, I’ve saved the business $10,000 over the past 3 months.” Be honest and don’t exaggerate. Try to think of things from the company’s point of view — nobody’s going to give you a raise just because you need extra cash. Do your homework. Before you meet with your boss, have a target salary in mind. Use sites like PayScale.com, SalaryScout.com, and GlassDoor.com to research the going rate for similar jobs in your area. (Better yet, ask around to see what colleagues at other firms are earning.) Seize the moment. The best time to ask for a raise is after a strong performance review or after your boss gives you new responsibilities. You’re not entitled to a raise simply for coming to work every day, but you’ve got a right to request one if you’re doing good work. Don’t complain. Be positive and professional: Emphasize your strengths and accomplishments, and give examples of how you’ve helped the company. Don’t gripe about your workload or other employees. Follow up. After your meeting, be sure to follow up on any promises your boss made. Get the details of the raise in writing, and keep an eye on your paycheck to make sure it goes up when it’s supposed to.
                

Page: 108
> Improve your skills. Even if you didn’t get a raise this year, you can increase your odds of future salary bumps by learning new things. Attend training sessions, go to seminars and conferences, and get certified in job-related skills. (Many companies will even pay for your classes.) You can then use your new skills at your current job — or to help you find a new one. Ask for non-monetary rewards. If there’s no room in your company’s budget for a raise, ask for other compensation, like an extra week of vacation, a more flexible schedule, or a better parking space.
                

Page: 109
> Tell your boss first. Respect the chain of command: Talk to your manager before telling your buddies you’re leaving. Be ready for a counter-offer. If you’re a valuable part of the company’s plans, they may try to get you to stay. Be prepared for this, and know what you’re going to say. (This is one reason it’s important not to lie when resigning: If the company offers to fix the things you claimed were wrong but they aren’t your real reasons for leaving, you could end up in an awkward position.) Leave in good standing. As tempting as it is to mentally check out before you’re done working for your old company, resist that urge. If you said you’d stay 2 more weeks, work during those 2 weeks. If you don’t, you put the company in a tough spot and make yourself look bad. You never know when you’ll need a reference from a former boss or find yourself working with former coworkers again.

> On The Money: Informational Interviews Finding a job can be tough. Competition is fierce, and even if you’ve got the right skills, it’s challenging to make yourself known to the right people. Informational interviews are a way to get an edge on your competition. These aren’t the same as job interviews — they’re an opportunity to learn more about a career or company. The first step in setting up one of these interviews is to find people with jobs that interest you. Prepare a simple list of questions to make sure you get the info you need when you contact these folks. It may help calm your nerves to approach the interview as if you were a reporter: Pretend you’re gathering facts for a news story. The cardinal rule of informational interviews is don’t ask for a job. If you tell somebody you’re just gathering info but then turn the meeting into a job interview, you’re just going to make her angry. (If she thinks you’re a promising candidate and she has a position available, she’ll contact you.) Here are some more guidelines: Ask politely. If the subject agrees to an interview, set a time and a date. If she’s not up for such an interview, respect her boundaries. Be prepared. Dress appropriately, be punctual, do your homework about the company or field, and be ready to ask intelligent, relevant questions. Listen. Ask open-ended questions, and then let the subject talk about herself and the company. Good questions include “What’s your typical workday like?” and “How is your company different from its competitors?” Take notes. You’re conducting this interview to learn more about a possible career, so write things down and ask follow-up questions. Be brief. Keep track of time. Don’t rush, but don’t overstay your welcome. Afterward, remember to send an email or hand-written note to thank the person for taking time to meet with you.

> Have a plan. Just as a budget is important for your personal finances, a business plan is key to entrepreneurial success. If your business is small, the plan can be as simple as a list of goals. But if you’re looking for outside funding or hope to take over the world, your plan needs to be as detailed as possible. You can find free sample business plans at www.Bplans.com. Don’t quit your day job — at least not at first. If possible, start by going solo on evenings and weekends to get a feel for your business and find out if you really want to pursue it full time. You may discover your new gig isn’t what you’d hoped for. Find advisors you trust. A new business is uncharted territory, so it’s really helpful to have guides. Heed the advice of your mentors, and find a good lawyer and accountant and follow their instructions. Play by the rules. Some small-business owners strike out on their own because they’re mavericks. This independence may make them think they can cut corners by not filling out paperwork or filing taxes, but shortcuts like these put everything at risk. It’s easier to do things right the first time than to sort out a mess later. Keep business and personal accounts separate. Don’t mingle work and personal funds; open a checking account specifically for the business. Then document everything that enters and leaves that account. Keep costs low. Do what you can to keep your overhead down. For example, don’t spend $1,000 on a fancy Aeron chair when you can pick up a decent desk chair from Goodwill for five bucks. You’ll be less stressed and have better odds of success if you don’t have a lot of bills dragging you down. Be willing to spend on training. Buy the books and manuals you need and pay for classes. Training like this is a necessary business expense, not a luxury. Keep good records. Business will be slow at first, so it won’t seem like a big deal that you keep receipts in a shoebox and don’t have a filing system. But in time, you’ll be flooded with paperwork. Get organized from the start to prevent future headaches. Note If you run a small business, take a look at Outright.com, a simple, free bookkeeping site. It’s like Mint or Wesabe (Web-Based Tools) for freelancers and small businesses. Be confident. When you start out, don’t let your customers know you’re nervous. They’re lost, too, and hoping you’ll guide them to the right product or service. So do research and become an expert. And if you make mistakes, learn from them. Charge the going rate — or close to it. If you start a house-cleaning service, don’t go in with low-ball bids. If you’re too cheap, people will think there’s a reason for it. Charge the going rate, and raise your price as demand increases. Have an exit strategy. Know where you’re going and why. Is your goal to sell your business? To have competent employees who can run things, leaving you to pursue other interests? Or is it just a lark, something you’ll do for fun for a few years before dropping it…

> As long as you don’t try to do it all at once, it’s not hard to sell your used Stuff. To keep things manageable, follow these steps: Sell your most valuable items on eBay. Hold a yard sale with everything else. Try to get rid of the remaining things on Craigslist. Donate the rest to charity. Depending on how much Stuff you have, this process can take weeks or months to finish. But when you’re done, you’ll have far less clutter around the house — and a fat wad of dough you can use to pay down debt or to save for that Hawaiian vacation.

Instead of opening a single CD and putting that whole amount in it, you’d open multiple CDs, all with the same maturation date. You could open five CDs of $1,000 each, say, or open two with $1,000 and one with $3,000.

> It makes you the priority. You’re telling yourself that you are more important than the electric company or the landlord. Think of the money you put into savings as a down payment on your future. It encourages sound financial habits. Most people spend their money in the following order: bills, fun, savings. But if you bump savings to the front of that list, you can set money aside before you come up with reasons to spend it. That way, since the money is no longer in your checking account to tempt you, you end up spending less. It builds a cash buffer you can use later in life. Regular contributions to a savings account are an excellent way to build a nest egg. You can then use the money to deal with emergencies, buy a home, or spend during retirement.

You can research cards at: CardRatings.com, which has a searchable database of credit cards, a blog with tips and news, and a forum where folks can write reviews of the cards they use. IndexCreditCards.com, which lists over 1,200 different cards and offers tips for using them wisely. BankRate.com, which has a bunch of online calculators to help you choose the best card for you.

If you belong to a credit union (Credit unions), you may be able to get a great deal on a card. A 2009 study from Pew Charitable Trusts (http://tinyurl.com/PCT-credit) found that "credit unions offered significantly lower advertised rates compared to bank credit cards, with penalty fees that were half the cost of comparable bank fees and fewer dangers associated with ‘unfair or deceptive’ practices.” In other words, credit unions rock. If you’re after a rewards card, choose one that offers something you value. Some give you frequent-flyer miles, others points. If these appeal to you, great. But there’s no sense in earning stuff you’ll never use, so don’t forget cash rewards. Cash is versatile and, unlike frequent-flyer miles, never expires. Watch out for extra fees. Some fancy cards will give you all sorts of perks — for a price. You’re usually better off with a no-fee card than paying $20 or $50 (or more!) every year for features you hardly use. Look for more than just a low interest rate. Though it sounds like gibberish, a credit card’s “method of computing the balance for purchases” is important. Look for cards that calculate your interest using either "average daily balance” or "adjusted balance.”

> When we got back to the showroom, we negotiated. I talked the salesman down to $15,000. I was patting myself on the back when the “closer” — a more experienced, higher-pressure salesman — sat down at the table. Armed with the info I’d told the first guy — that I had $17,000 to spend, was willing to pay at least $15,000, and really liked the car — he spent an hour talking me up to $15,600. I could (and should) have walked away, but I’d become emotionally invested: I wanted to drive that car home. In the end, I paid $15,600 — and I traded in my old car for much less than it was worth. That’s exactly the wrong way to buy a car, yet nearly everyone does the same thing. We get emotionally attached to a vehicle and convince ourselves we have to buy today, so the dealer gets to call the shots. Fortunately, there are smarter ways to buy.

> On The Money: Saying Goodbye to Car Payments Despite what you might think, you’re not doomed to have a car payment for the rest of your life. In Chapter 7, you learned the importance of paying yourself first to save for retirement (Get in the game). You can apply the same principle to saving for a car. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, the average price of a new car is just over $28,000. Let’s say you put $8,000 down to buy a car at that price, and you finance the remaining $20,000 for 4 years at 9% interest, meaning your payments will be just under $500 per month. At the end of those 4 years, you’ll have paid almost $32,000 for a car that’s now worth $14,000. That’s $18,000 vanished into thin air! There is a better way, one recommended by financial gurus like Dave Ramsey and Suze Orman. Instead of financing a new car, take that $8,000 and use it to buy a high-quality used car. Then, instead of paying $500 a month to the finance company, set the money aside in a named bank account specifically for your next car (see Targeted Savings Accounts). That way you’re paying yourself rather than the car company. At the end of a year, your used car will have lost 15% or so of its value, making it worth around $6,800. You can keep driving it and saving for a new car, or take the $6,000 you now have in the bank, combine it with the used car’s value, and trade in for a car worth $12,800. And if you keep saving, the next year you can trade in that second car for one worth $17,000. In theory, after 4 years of this you’ll have paid out $32,000 — just as if you’d bought that new car at 9% interest — but you’ll be driving a car worth $23,000 instead of $14,000. Pretty cool, yeah? Instead of paying interest to a finance company for a vehicle that’s losing value, you’re paying yourself and gradually upgrading your car every year.

Here are some sites to try: Edmunds.com lets you compare the suggested retail price with the dealer invoice price and what other people in your area are actually paying. Autobytel.com offers info similar to Edmunds.com and gives you a chance to get competitive bids from dealers near you. Consumer Reports has a popular new-car pricing service (http://tinyurl.com/CR-carprice). For $14, you can get a report that includes the dealer invoice price and all possible options, a list of dealer rebates, a theoretical rock-bottom price, and negotiating tips. You can also find out if the manufacturer is offering any rebates or incentives to lower the cost of the car by hopping onto Autopedia.com: http://tinyurl.com/AP-rebates. Armed with your pricing info, it’s time to make a deal.

> Be sure you’re talking about the drive-it-off-the-lot price. The salespeople will try hard to negotiate around a monthly payment amount; ignore that. Because you took care of the money beforehand (Money matters), you don’t care about the monthly payment. All that matters is the price you’re going to pay to drive the car home. (Seriously, this is a huge trap to avoid: Whatever you do, don’t get caught up in discussing monthly payments.) Don’t negotiate more than one thing at once. Dealers love to negotiate lots of things at the same time — purchase price, monthly payments, trade-in value, and so on — because that gives them a chance to give a little in one area while making a killing in another. Insist on taking care of one thing at a time.

> Power is the ability to get things done. You can gain power in a negotiation by generating competition (having three contractors bid to re-roof your house, for example). Other tactics are to use persistence, precedence (“This is how I’ve always done it”), empathy (understanding the other side), perceived legitimacy (”Consumer Reports says this model isn’t as good as others”), and silence (not saying anything at all will often cause the other side to continue negotiating, as if you’d made a counter-offer). Time also plays a role — the side with the most time has the advantage. No matter how rushed you are, keep your cool. Don’t ignore deadlines, but don’t follow them blindly either. Information is the final variable: The more you know, the better off you are, so do your research before you start haggling. And during negotiations, act on whatever new info comes to light: Has this model been discontinued? Does it have a scratch? Did the store order too many? Use this knowledge to adjust your offer.

This concern is understandable (it’s happened to both me and my wife), but you can reduce the risk by being a smart shopper. If you feel more comfortable buying from a dealer than a private party, consider a certified used car. These may cost a little more than other used vehicles, but they come with a warranty (and possibly other features) that can give you peace of mind. But be careful: “certified” has become a marketing buzzword. Make sure the car is certified by the manufacturer — anything else is meaningless.

Ask questions. Whether you’re buying from a dealer or a private party, find out as much as you can about the car. How many owners has it had? Has it ever been in an accident? Are all the maintenance records available? What sort of gas mileage does it get? Why is it for sale? Tip For $35, you can get the Carfax (www.carfax.com) vehicle history report, which tells you if the car has been in any accidents, how many owners it’s had, and so on. (Better yet, if you’re buying from a dealer, ask them to pull the report for you — there’s a good chance they already have it on file.) Inspect the car thoroughly. Check the interior, exterior, tires, tailpipe, and engine. When you test drive it, pay attention to the handling and acceleration, and listen for strange noises. Take the vehicle to an independent mechanic. For $100–$150, a mechanic can tell you if the car has any major problems. Make an offer. Start below what you think the car is worth (minus the cost of any repairs it needs) and work up from there. Trust your gut. If something bugs you about the deal, call it off.

> Prep your vehicle. Make sure everything works. Consider having a mechanic check the car and issue a report about its condition. And clean the car (inside and out) until it shines. Research the market. Spend a few weeks reading used-car ads in the newspaper and on Craigslist.org to see what people are asking for similar vehicles. And use the Kelley Blue Book or NADA Guides sites (Selling a Car) to get more info. Set a competitive price. Figure out what you think your car is worth — being honest about its condition and value — then add a little to the price for wiggle room during negotiations. Decide what your rock-bottom price is. Gather your records. Put together a folder with all your car’s maintenance records. If you had a mechanic inspect the car, include his report. Consider getting a vehicle report from Carfax.com to help set the buyer’s mind at ease. And have a bill-of-sale document ready to go. (What you need for a bill of sale depends on where you live, so check your state’s DMV website for details.) Write an ad that sells. Mention features, improvements, and any recent upgrades, like new tires or battery. Have you always parked it in a garage? Say so. Do you have all the maintenance records? Mention that, too. And if you’re posting an ad online, include as many photos as you can. Spread the word. Get as much exposure for your ad as possible. The more demand you can generate, the more money you’ll make. Online, try Craigslist.org, Autotrader.com, and Cars.com. Run your ad in a newspaper over the weekend when it’ll reach the largest audience. Be prepared to answer questions. People will call or email to ask for detailed info. Be ready to provide it by keeping a list of key facts near the phone. Show your car to interested buyers. If you’re nervous about dealing with people, get a friend to help. You’re selling yourself as well as the car, so make a good impression. Let the buyer test-drive it, but be sure to ask for a valid driver’s license first. Go along for the ride, or ask for some sort of collateral (their car keys or wallet, say). If your car has any major defects, be honest about them. Offer to let the buyer take the car to a mechanic of their choice, even if you’ve already taken it to yours. Negotiate a price. A good price is fair to both parties. Having done your research, you know what your car is worth, so be confident and stand strong when somebody tries to lowball you. Remember your rock-bottom price, but if you get an offer that’s only a couple hundred dollars below this figure, consider accepting it. Make the sale. Get cash or a cashier’s check, and then complete the bill of sale to transfer ownership. Be certain that the paperwork includes a statement to this effect: “This vehicle is sold as is. Buyer assumes all liability and guarantees the vehicle will be registered in their name immediately.” Take care of the details. After the sale, cancel your insurance policy for the car and complete any necessary DMV paperwork.

Also be sure the mechanic is certified by the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (www.ase.com). Once you find a candidate, take your car in for its next oil change. If you get a good vibe, use the shop for future service and repairs. If something bugs you about the shop, go elsewhere. Even after you find a good shop, always check your bill and be willing to ask questions. It’s your right to know what you were charged and why. If a mechanic knows you’re going to watch the bill, he’s less likely to try pulling a fast one.

Hypermilers — people obsessed with getting the best fuel economy — recommend turning off your engine if you stop for more than 10 seconds. Even if you’re not that hardcore, try to commute when traffic is lighter and plan routes with as few traffic signals as possible to spend less time idling. Consolidate trips.

To do that, you give your basic financial info to a lender, who then does a quick calculation to give you a rough estimate of how much you can afford to spend on a house. Bear in mind that the bank isn’t actually agreeing to loan you this amount; they’re simply saying, “We think you can afford this much house — we’ll work out the exact numbers later.” You’re usually better off getting pre-approved for a loan instead. Pre-approval is more formal than pre-qualifying, and it takes days instead of minutes. The lender will pull your credit report, review your financial info, and check your employment history before giving you a pre-approval letter. This process may actually cost you money, but pre-approval gives you the confidence that you can actually afford the homes you’re looking at, and gives sellers confidence that you’ll be able to get a loan.

Low fees. Find out what sorts of fees each lender charges. Closing costs (like those listed here: http://tinyurl.com/FR-closing) can have a big impact on the total cost of the mortgage, but many people ignore them, probably because the cost of the mortgage is so huge that these charges seem small by comparison.

> The type of mortgage you take out will depend on your goals and your financial situation. Most people opt for a mortgage with a fixed 15- or 30-year term. Here’s some info that can help you decide which is best for you: Interest rates on 15-year mortgages are lower than those on 30-year loans, but because the loan is only half as long, your monthly payments are higher. (See the table above to compare monthly payments.) If you can keep saving for retirement and other goals despite the higher monthly payments, a 15-year-loan is a great option because it’ll save you a bundle in interest. But if it’s going to crimp your cash flow, go with a 30-year mortgage instead. For most people, a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is the best choice. The monthly payments are lower than with a 15-year loan, and you have greater flexibility. If you want to pay more than the minimum amount every month, you can (see Should you prepay your mortgage?), but you don’t have to. This gives you a kind of safety net: If you lose your job, say, it’s easier to make the payments on a 30-year loan than a 15-year loan.

A CLUE report tells you what sorts of claims were filed at the address during the past 7 years. You can’t order this report yourself — only the person who owns the property can. Get an independent inspection. A good inspection will cost several hundred dollars, but it’s worth every penny. Ask friends, family, and coworkers to recommend inspectors. Don’t use an inspector recommended by the seller, broker, or real-estate agent; you want somebody who’s thorough and tough, and whose livelihood isn’t tied to others in the process. Tag along during the inspection and ask questions. (You may want to film the house at this time.) Don’t panic if the inspector finds problems; instead, use them to negotiate. Talk to the neighbors. Ask about the house and the neighborhood. The seller may be reluctant to spill the beans on the garage conversion he did without a permit, but the old guy next door probably won’t be. Stay on top of things. The home-buying process involves a lot of people, and they’re usually juggling lots of other deals, too. Don’t be afraid to be the squeaky wheel that needs a little grease. Your questions may drive people crazy, but that’s okay. What’s worse: To annoy the title-insurance company or to lose tens of thousands of dollars because you were too chicken to speak up? Do a final walk-through. On the day before you close the sale, ask to take one final pass through the house. Are the window treatments there? Are the light fixtures still the same? Have requested repairs been made? Your goal here isn’t to do another home inspection or to find things to negotiate on, just to be sure everything’s in the same condition as when you made the offer.

What happens if you discover there’s a penalty for prepaying the mortgage? Or that the contract specifies a term of 15 years instead of 30 years? If you don’t read the contract, you have nobody to blame but yourself if something goes wrong. If you need to, have a lawyer review the paperwork.

> Should you prepay your mortgage? You can save tens of thousands of dollars by paying your mortgage off early. But is it a smart move? You won’t find a definitive answer in this book or anywhere else. Ask a dozen different financial experts and you’ll get a dozen different answers — literally: http://tinyurl.com/invest-prepay. Why wouldn’t you pay off your mortgage early? There are actually several sensible reasons you might choose to hang onto that debt: If you prepay in good times, there’s no easy way to get that money back during bad times. The only way to “undo” prepayments is to take out a second mortgage. When you have a mortgage, inflation is your friend: In 30 years, your $2,000 monthly payment will seem like a $500 payment. No matter how much you prepay, the bank doesn’t give you a break — you still have to make payments each month until the mortgage is completely paid off, even if you get sick or lose your job. There’s an opportunity cost to prepaying your mortgage: When you send in an extra payment, you can’t use that money elsewhere — such as investing in the stock market, which might give you a better return. Despite these compelling arguments, millions of Americans prepay their mortgages. Their reasons make sense, too: Prepaying gives you a guaranteed return on your investment equal to whatever your mortgage rate is. That’s because any time you pay down debt, you earn a return equal to the interest rate you’re being charged. So if your home loan has a 6% interest rate, then paying extra on that debt is like earning 6% in a savings account. You’d be hard-pressed to find other places to earn a guaranteed 6% return! Prepaying gives you a safety net. While you’ll still have a mortgage payment until you’ve paid off the loan, when you do pay it off, you’ll have a huge cushion because your monthly expenses will drop by $1,000, $2,000, or even $3,000. Just think of what you could do with that cash flow! People who’ve paid off their homes feel a huge sense of relief (see http://tinyurl.com/GRS-nomortgage). It’s freeing to not have a mortgage holding you down. Few people would argue that prepaying your mortgage is a bad move, but there are some who don’t think it’s the best move. Is prepayment right for you? If you plan to stay in your home for a long time, it may be. The choice depends on your financial goals and what will make you happy. Note When should you refinance your mortgage? When you can recover the costs in a reasonable amount of time, typically just a few years. The standard advice used to be to consider refinancing if interest rates dropped by 2%. But closing costs are lower now, and it often makes sense to refinance sooner. You’ll need to run the numbers based on your own situation using a refinance calculator like the one here: http://tinyurl.com/refi-calc.

The deductible is the amount you pay on a loss before the insurance company kicks in money. For instance, if your car suffers $400 in damage and you have a $250 deductible, you pay the first $250 and your insurance company pays the rest. It’s up to you where to set the deductible, but the lower your deductible, the higher your monthly premiums. Ask yourself how much you can afford to pay if something goes wrong; more specifically, how much is too much? Set your deductible just below “too much.” Consolidate.

> Self-insurance isn’t just a good strategy for appliances. Try raising the deductibles on your auto and home insurance policies. Then take the difference between your old premiums and your new premiums and put it into your self-insurance account every month. It won’t take long for you to have more than enough to cover the deductible.

Instead, it may be more cost effective to buy an umbrella policy, which gives you extra liability coverage above what your home and auto policies provide.

> Ditch towing coverage. Towing — or “emergency roadside service,” as it’s sometimes called — is an easy cost to self-insure (see General Insurance Tips). You likely pay $10–$30 a year for towing insurance, and one tow costs $100. (If you’re in an accident, towing is usually covered under collision, but check with your insurance company to be sure.) Sometimes your car will break down, but if it’s well maintained, that won’t happen often.

> Savings accounts are great for short-term goals; inflation may do a little damage, but it doesn’t have time to compound. If you want to achieve your big goals over the long term, you need to do more than just boost your cash flow and stick money in savings. The best way to do this is to invest in the stock market because, over the long-term, stocks offer the best possible return. (When talking about investments, your return is the amount you earn or lose.)

Over the past 80 years, stocks have produced a real return (meaning an inflation-adjusted return) of 6.8%, which also happens to be their average rate of return for the past 200 years. Bonds have returned about 5%. Adjusted for inflation, their real return has been about 2.4%.

In general, the movements of stocks, bonds, commodities (The Tools of Investing), and real estate aren’t strongly correlated; for example, just because the stock market is down doesn’t mean the real estate market will be down, too. The same is generally true of the returns on these asset classes — they’re normally independent of each other. (But sometimes, as in the recent financial crisis, there’s a whole lot of correlation going on!) Over time. “Risk is also reduced for investors who build up a retirement nest egg by putting their money in the market regularly over time,” writes Burton Malkiel in The Random Walk Guide to Investing. By using techniques like dollar-cost averaging (see All-in-one funds), you ensure that you’re not investing all your money when the market is high.

> On The Money: The High Cost of Trading Here’s a dirty little secret: Wall Street makes money on activity; you make money on inactivity. When you buy and sell securities, you have to pay somebody else to make those trades for you. And every time you pay them, you lose a little piece of your savings. This isn’t a huge deal if you don’t trade often, but if you buy and sell all the time, you’re giving your money away. For example, say it costs 1% each time you sell what you currently own and buy something new. If you do this once a month, you have to earn 12% more every year than the guy who sits there and does nothing. This example is an exaggeration, but studies show that speculators who trade often — usually because they’re chasing the latest hot stock — tend to earn less than investors who take a long-term view. If you want to get an idea of how much money the financial industry siphons from unwary investors, read James B. Stewart’s Den of Thieves (Touchstone, 1992), a true-life account of the insider trading scandals of the 1980s that’ll blow your mind.

> At the end of the year, rebalance your portfolio, which simply means shifting money around so your assets are allocated the way you want them to be. Doing this is another way to take the emotion out of investing, because you’re investing based on a plan instead of a whim. There are two ways to rebalance: You can sell enough of your winners and buy enough of your losers to bring things back into balance. By selling the investments that have grown and buying those that lag behind, you’re following the Wall Street mantra to “buy low, sell high.” Be aware, though, that you might owe taxes if you go this route, so check out the tax implications before you sell any securities. If you can afford it, contribute new money to your investment account, but only to buy the assets that need to catch up. For instance, if you only have 34% in bonds instead of your target 40%, add more bonds to bring your portfolio back into balance. By doing this, you don’t have to worry about taxes, but you will need some cash on hand.

> “Rebalancing is a personal choice, not a choice that statistics can validate.

If you have money left, put as much as you can into your 401(k) (see Funding Your Future with a 401(k)).

You always own the money you’ve put into the plan yourself, but you only gradually gain ownership of your company’s contributions. You might own none of them during the first year you participate, for example, 20% the second year, and so on. If you leave the company before you’re fully vested, you won’t get 100% of the money they contributed. Check with your company’s HR department to learn more.

If your company’s 401(k) plan is lousy (it has high fees and poor selection, say), move the money into an IRA (Learning to Love Roth IRAs) when you leave the company.

> Learning to Love Roth IRAs Even if your company doesn’t offer a retirement plan, you can still save for the future. One of the best ways to do so is with a Roth IRA. An IRA is an individual retirement arrangement, a retirement plan that gives you tax advantages when saving for retirement. There are two types of IRAs: With a traditional IRA (first introduced in 1975), the money you put in is typically tax deductible, but the money you pull out at retirement will be taxed at the then-current rate. With a Roth IRA (first introduced in 1997), you contribute after-tax dollars, but when you retire, you don’t have to pay taxes on the returns the money earned. (These IRAs get their name from Delaware senator William Roth, who helped pass the law that created them.) In other words, money in a traditional IRA is taxed when you withdraw it, but the money in a Roth IRA is taxed before you contribute it. (For more on the difference between Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs, see the box on Extreme Retirement Saving.) You make investments in an IRA through an individual retirement account. Many folks use the term “IRA” interchangeably to refer to both individual retirement arrangements and individual retirement accounts, but there are some important differences. You have just one Roth IRA, for example, but you can have many Roth IRA accounts. That is, you can have a Roth IRA account at your credit union and one with your mutual fund company, but they’re both part of the same IRA. (It’s kind of like how this page and the last one are both part of the same book.) One important thing to realize is that an IRA isn’t itself an investment — it’s a place to put investments. When you open an IRA account, it’s like an empty bucket just waiting to be filled. The things you put into your IRA bucket are investments. You might, for example, buy stocks to put into your bucket, or maybe bonds. Some people use their IRA accounts to buy investment real estate, and some simply let their cash sit there, earning interest in CDs, just as it would if it were deposited in the bank down the street (which may actually be where they keep their IRA account!). As you might expect after reading the last chapter, smart people mix up the contents of their IRA accounts over time. Their buckets might contain a combination of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, and real estate. (When you start out, your bucket will probably hold just a single investment, and that’s fine.)

If your circle of friends makes a habit of a specific activity, build it into your budget so it doesn’t catch you by surprise. If your coworkers go out for happy hour on the first Thursday of every month, for example, set aside $20 to join them. Leave your money at home. If you’re worried that you’ll cave to peer pressure, create a self-imposed limit. Take $5 or $10 or $20 with you, but leave the plastic behind. If you don’t have the money with you, you can’t spend it. Limit yourself. Do things with friends, just spend less.

When your friends complain about money, don’t make a big deal out of it. Share your story, and mention the tools that helped you turn things around (like this book!).

> Next, put the rest of the money into an account where it can earn interest while you decide what to do (a 3- or 6-month CD is a good choice — see Money market accounts).

Live your life just as you did before.

> Social Capital You create social capital — mutual goodwill — when you volunteer at a soup kitchen, help your neighbor move a piano, have your Sunday School class over for a barbeque, or join a softball league. Any time you participate in your community, you’re generating social capital, both for yourself and the other people involved. People with lots of social capital can find help when they need it; those with little social capital can spend a lot of time frustrated and alone. The classic Christmas film It’s a Wonderful Life is a great illustration of social capital. Jimmy Stewart plays George Bailey, a man who repeatedly foregoes his own interests to help his friends and neighbors. It costs him — financially and mentally. When disaster strikes, Bailey decides he’s worth more dead than alive, and plans to commit suicide so that the proceeds from his life-insurance policy can set things right.
