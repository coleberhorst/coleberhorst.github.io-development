> When you are dependent on good things happening to make you feel good, your life becomes centered on preserving a good mood. This will constrain you, because if you are constantly worried about avoiding anything negative, you will never do anything out of the ordinary.

Page: 8
> For reading that covers the topic of an upcoming lecture, it's often sufficient to just skim the main points ahead of time, and then fill in the gaps during class by taking very good notes.            

Page: 8
> The secret is to read chapter introductions and conclusions carefully, and then skim everything else.
                

Page: 8
> When multiple books are assigned as background for a paper, find out early exactly what your paper topic will be, and read only the material you need to develop your specific thesis. Skip optional readings. With all due respect to your professors, there are better uses for your limited time.
                

Page: 9
> For science courses, you will typically be assigned one or two chapters of dense technical material to review for each class. These assignments almost always cover the exact same topics that the professor will detail in lecture. Skim these chapters quickly so you know what to expect, but put the bulk of your energy into concentrating in class.
                

Page: 10
> The secret is to engage in the same focusing ritual every Sunday morning—something that wakes up your mind and gets your day moving. Read the paper with a strong cup of coffee, take a walk with a friend, go for a jog followed by a hot shower, or spend some time browsing in a nearby bookstore. Then, with your intellectual energy piqued, and your focus strong, settle into a quiet spot at the library and start working. While other students slumber, you will have a full, undisturbed day to get ahead of your work obligations.

> When assigned a long-term project, finish some amount of work toward its completion that very same day.

> By keeping your living space in order there will be fewer distractions, and you will feel in control of your environment.

> Here is what you should do: Contact your dean's office, Career Services Center, and departments relating to your field of study. Ask them for information on scholarships, fellowships, and awards. Also, use Web-based services such as FastWeb (www.fastweb.com) and FinAid! (www.finaid.org) to search for additional national scholarships for which you are eligible. Talk to the companies where your parents, aunts, uncles, and siblings work; find out if they offer any student scholarships. And finally, look for scholarships from companies or organizations in any industry of interest to you. From this large hit list, choose up to ten scholarships that best fit your abilities, passions, and accomplishments. Mark the deadlines on your calendar and apply to every single one of them when the time is right. Do this every year.
                

Page: 20
> You should never begin studying without a systemized plan for what you are going to review, in what format, and how many times.
                

Page: 23
> Don't worry. Making an ally of a professor is not a difficult task. Professors enjoy interacting with their students; it is often the only feedback they get on how well they are doing their job. To create a meaningful connection, you should begin with regular attendance at office hours. Some students worry that they don't have any specific problems to discuss. The secret is to be observant. There are many more opportunities to speak with a professor than you might realize at first. When you are working on a paper, you can see the professor to talk about possible topics, then again to get feedback on the idea you selected, and then again to check the structure of your argument once you begin writing.
                

Page: 25
> Find a club on campus that excites you and join as soon as possible. Work hard, attend all the meetings, take positions of responsibility whenever they are available, and follow a path into a leadership position. If you have a strong idea for an organization that doesn't already exist, this is even better.
                

Page: 27
> If your brain is a muscle, then reading a newspaper is like mental calisthenics. In order to succeed in an academic environment your mind has to be constantly energized, confident, and ready to engage. With this in mind, you should read a newspaper every day.
                

Page: 29
> develop a skill you can be known for. Again, this is not about bragging rights. People can know you are good at something without you having to constantly remind them. This is about reinforcing your identity and sense of self-confidence.
                

Page: 32
> Here is the most important rule you will ever hear about student time management: Daily to-do lists do not work at college. Your schedule is too complicated and too unpredictable. Some assignments could easily take up your entire evening, while others may take just minutes. Friends will drop by unexpectedly, meals will last for hours, and interesting opportunities for fun will pop up at the last moment. A to-do list can't tame this hectic lifestyle. If you blindly move through the day, trying to accomplish tasks from a list whenever it seems like you have some free time, you will get very little done. Here is a better way to take control of your schedule: Every morning, before your first class, rip a sheet of paper out of your notebook. Go down the left-hand margin marking the waking hours of the day using every other line as a guide. Now block out the hours you will be in class. Then block out the hours you will be eating meals, and when you will be in meetings or other scheduled events. The white space that remains represents the free time that you have available to work with for the day.
                

Page: 43
> If you want to stand out at college you should foster an attitude of “anything is possible.” And one of the best ways to develop this attitude is to constantly be working on a “Grand Project.” To begin with, reflect on your most heartfelt aspirations. If you could be doing anything five years from now, what would it be? Then design and follow an ambitious Grand Project that moves you toward your answer. For example, if you get excited about the idea of writing for The New Yorker, you might create a Grand Project to first publish a series of intelligent nonfiction pieces for your school paper, then a local paper, then a second-tier national publication on your way to the big time. If you dream of screenwriting in Hollywood, you might research a list of every upcoming student-film-writing contest, tack the deadlines on your wall, and work on finishing an original screenplay in time to be submitted to all of them. Or, if you are motivated by young entrepreneur success stories, you might jot down a clever business idea, create a Web site, and launch your very own dorm-room corporation.
                

Page: 44
> Your Grand Project should consist of a group of achievable, nonacademic accomplishments that, when combined, move you closer to an exciting aspiration. Think big. Be ambitious. When you explain a Grand Project to someone it should elicit a response of “Wow!” Working on such a project will keep you constantly excited and energetic. It will keep the pressures of course work in perspective, and make it easy to brush aside the little bad occurrences that pop up now and then. When you work on a highly ambitious project, you feel invincible, like you are a step ahead of the rest of the world, forging unique paths to great success. It doesn't matter if you don't always succeed. The novelty and thrill of taking chances is a powerful force.
                

Page: 49
> Sound good? Well, get used to it. If you want to succeed at college, try to put yourself in this situation, in one class, for one assignment, every semester. The advantages of blowing the curve on an assignment are obvious. It will help your grade, the professor will remember and support you with great recommendations and advice, and it will just plain make you feel good about yourself.
                

Page: 51
> Make sure that you always ask at least one question at every lecture. The night before, when you are doing the reading that will be covered in the lecture, jot down a quick list of questions that seem relevant.
                

Page: 53
> Research is where all the action is. If you really want to stand out at your college, you need to be in the middle of this action.
                

Page: 58
> When you do schoolwork, be it reading, taking notes, working on a lab, or memorizing verbs, try to do everything in fifty-minute chunks. Take ten-minute breaks in between each fifty-minute chunk. This is key for any successful student.
                

Page: 61
> Fortunately, there is an unconventional yet simple way to both avoid these problems and ensure that you get the perfect amount of rest and relaxation: Schedule your free time. Most people consider free time to be any time when they are not explicitly working. All you need to do is flip this understanding, and say that work time is any time that you are not explicitly relaxing. When you create your schedule each morning, you need to do two things. First, choose an end point for the day. For example, you might say that ten P.M. is the end of your workday, and from that point on you will just relax until you go to sleep. Second, decide exactly when you are going to relax throughout the day.
                

Page: 63
> Track pants, a slightly stained T-shirt, flip-flops, and a baseball cap do not count as “getting dressed” in the morning. Nor does it count if you are wearing any article of clothing that you slept in the night before, or frequently wear to the gym. You should always take the time to brush your teeth, shower, tame your hair, and put on a good-looking outfit every morning before heading to class.
                

Page: 65
> Your room decor should create a space that is both comfortable and a healthy reflection of your personality. This doesn't necessarily mean going crazy with fancy furniture, walls of quirkily framed photographs, sheets that match a coordinated rug and curtains set, or, God forbid, Christmas lights. But it does mean moving beyond barren walls punctuated only with the occasional predictable poster. Why decorate? Because it will have a positive effect on your mood and energy. To wake up, go to sleep, and take breaks throughout the day in a personalized and comfortable room is refreshing.
                

Page: 66
> Buy three matted black frames, put a print in each, and hang them in an aesthetically pleasing row above your desk. Are you a movie buff? Find posters for two or three movies that you think are particularly influential.
                

Page: 66
> While you are at it, find an alternative to the fluorescent lights in your room. Two good floor lamps and a solid desk lamp can fill your room with a nice incandescent glow. Put a rug on the floor, as cheap carpet or tile is depressing when left uncovered. And buy a piece of furniture that makes you happy. Maybe find a beat-up sofa, or a used armchair, or anything comfortable that you can sink down into while you watch TV or read a book.
                

Page: 69
> The point of this depressing arithmetic is to highlight the reality of preparing for big exams: You have to start studying well in advance. Your schedule is busier than you think, and if you leave a large chunk of studying until the last days before an exam, you will be forced to sacrifice.
                

Page: 71
> You probably get the point here: Writing is really, really important for a college student. You will succeed academically only if you have the ability to express your thoughts clearly and convincingly. This means that if you want to win at college, you need to be good at writing. Really good at writing.
                

Page: 76
> You need to journey to a place where you will be cut off from everyday student life, a place that provides you with a chance to relax and regain your sense of identity. The Student Union doesn't count. Your dorm TV lounge doesn't count. Your friend's room down the hall certainly doesn't count. To misquote a once famous line: You need to get the hell out of Dodge. Going to Barnes & Noble, grabbing a stack of books, and reading them over a cup of gourmet coffee is a good example of a great escape. So is taking a long drive in the country, or going for a long jog at an off-campus park. Schedule an escape for yourself every single week. And do it alone. Treat it like taking medicine.

Page: 81
> As long as we are trying to take all the fun out of studying, here is another stab to the heart: Don't study in groups. At first glance, multiperson study sessions seem to have a lot of advantages: they are social; they hold you accountable for learning material; they reduce the amount of material you have to study on your own; and they provide a safety net of people to help you understand difficult topics. Unfortunately, study groups also tend to have a rather major strike against them. They don't work!
                

Page: 81
> The best way to learn difficult material is to go over it by yourself, with a lot of concentration, again and again and again until the concepts become second nature. There is no substitute for this type of learning. As boring or daunting as it may seem, you really do need to sit at your quiet desk in the library and absorb the material in all its detail.

Page: 87
> You should try to attend at least two guest lectures every month.
                

Page: 89
> What's the solution? Stop trying to convince yourself. Don't let the decision to exercise become a debatable question. Instead, make it a habit, like going to class or brushing your teeth. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays always hit the gym. Do it at the exact same time, for the exact same duration. If you are exercising for energy and health (as opposed to a desire to develop grapefruit-size biceps), you should create a fast routine. Use only a one-hour burst of activity in which to get to the gym, work out, and return to your dorm room. Quick routines are more time efficient and thus easier to schedule consistently.
                

Page: 91
> Stay in touch with your friends from back home. It can be surprisingly easy to lose touch with the important people in your life. College is so socially, mentally, and physically consuming that if you don't make a specific effort to keep in touch, you will lose your connection to your back-home buds.
                

Page: 102
> A good rule is to always use three days to write your short papers. This doesn't mean spending three days working on the paper; it means spending three days actually writing. Before your fingers first hit the keyboard, you need to finish any necessary preparation. Go back through your readings and notes and figure out what you want to say. Make an outline of your points, write out your thesis with crystal-clear clarity, and have the sources you need to quote readily available.
                

Page: 102
> Once you have your ideas and materials organized, it's time to spend three days writing. That's right, three. The first day is the hardest. If possible, make the first day a weekend day, or a weekday when you don't have many obligations. On this first day try to power through your outline and build a rough draft of the entire paper. Get all of your ideas written down. This first draft will take a while to write as you will be consuming and organizing a lot of thoughts all at once. It will also be long. Probably much longer than your assigned page limit.
                

Page: 102
> Your second day should be much easier than your first. Go back through your massive rough draft, tighten up your wording, cut out excess arguments, and add support where it seems to be
                

Page: 103
> Finally we come to the third day, which is the easiest. Make another run through your paper, this time really polishing the details of your arguments where they might still feel a little thin. Make sure all your support is clearly defined and advances your thesis. Check that all your sentences read well, that the ideas flow logically, and look for any remaining grammatical mistakes.
                

Page: 103
> Go back and rework your introduction and conclusion to make them exactly match the final form of your paper. Print out and edit your writing with a pencil at least twice. There is something about reading text on a computer screen that makes it easy to overlook stupid mistakes.

> Now, here is the important part: Once you have landed upon this magic number of sleep hours, keep it consistent.
                

Page: 108
> Take the hour before an exam to relax. Think of it as an Olympic athlete would, training for the mile-run. In the weeks leading up to the competition the athlete trains hard. But on the day of the race, he rests and conserves his energy so that he can be ready to compete hard when the starting gun fires. Your studying is your training, and the hour before the exam is your prerace rest period.

> Perhaps I should begin by explaining what this rule doesn't mean, lest some of you get the wrong idea. This rule doesn't mean that honing your video-game skills with your roommate should be your number one priority. This rule doesn't mean that making sure no friend ever watches TV alone should be your number one priority.
                

Page: 111
> Striking a balance between work and friends is not that difficult. The key is to plan ahead. Arrange to have one meal with some friends almost every day (see Rule #28, “Eat Alone Twice a Day”). You can e-mail them in advance, or just ask buddies who live nearby on the way to the dining hall. You can also arrange to eat with one particular person at a certain time on a certain day each week.
                

Page: 111
> If a friend invites you to do something, and you are really busy, don't go, but make plans to get together later in the week. Most important, if a good friend needs help, drop everything and go.
                

Page: 112
> Going out and having a couple of drinks on a Friday or Saturday night might slow you down a little the next morning, but it's nothing a quart of Starbucks and a couple of Advil can't handle. However, if you go out and binge drink—that is, consume alcohol until your speech is slurred, your gait shaky, and your stomach nauseated—no latte in the world is going to perk you up the next morning, and you will have just lost an entire day of productivity. A serious hangover makes it impossible to accomplish what you need to accomplish, not to mention that it weakens your body in general, makes you more susceptible to sickness, and leaves you feeling downright miserable. You can drink and still win at college. But you can't regularly binge drink and expect to succeed. Be mature and make the right decisions to keep your mind and body in a condition to perform your best.
                

Page: 114
> Because different students' grades on any given test or paper are not directly comparable. For example, say you receive an 84 on a test and your classmate receives a 93. Your initial instinct is to see her as the superior intellect, the one who had an easier time mastering the subject at hand. But imagine all the factors that could have gone into that 93. Maybe she just happened to focus her studying on a specific book or topic about which a lot of questions were asked on that particular exam. Maybe an unusually light schedule the week before gave her time to really log some long hours during her preparation. Maybe she bombed her last test so she put everything she had into knocking this one out of the ballpark. Maybe she just got more sleep the night before.

> How do you upgrade your notion of personal success? One easy method is to seek out phenomenal achievers.
                

Page: 119
> If you are in a group or talking with a professor, and a topic worthy of discussion comes up, you gain nothing by jumping right in and providing what seems to you to be the obviously correct opinion. You might be right, or you might be wrong, but who cares? This is an opportunity (a) to increase other people's esteem and respect for you, and (b) to learn.
                

Page: 120
> For example, don't debate gun control by arguing about the danger of handguns. Instead, discuss your different interpretations of the second amendment and what strategies or historical examples of constitutional disputes can best help you reconcile your disagreement. The former will lead to a lot of righteous indignation and heated tempers, the latter will help both of you understand the issue with more clarity. You are probably never going to convince an opponent that they are wrong, so why waste time being dogmatic? The beauty of this approach is that it works just as well in a classroom discussion of constitutional jurisprudence as it does when shooting the breeze with a friend. If you learn to listen, not only will you develop a much clearer understanding of issues that you care about, but you will also gain other people's respect.
                

Page: 123
> Don't decide to start working the day before. It's really that simple. When you know a test or a paper is coming up, schedule in advance the days you need to work on it. Then, on those days, give priority to this work. If you get only one thing done on the days leading up to a big deadline, make it your studying or writing first, and everything else later. Take staying up all night off your list of options. It should never be considered a viable approach for getting things done.

> This rule is absolutely essential. Without it, you have a zero percent chance of ever graduating college. Okay, maybe not. It's not that a low-quality notebook will be unable to meet your needs, but the general concept of investing in your school supplies is surprisingly important. If you take notes in a cheap, frayed, spiral notebook—sometimes cramming several classes' notes into the same space to the point where there is always a serious search necessitated before you can ever find what you are looking for—this will impact your retention of the material.

> When studying, buy a separate folder to hold all your review sheets, summarized notes, practice tests, and related material. You get the idea.
                

Page: 130
> If you have a hard time working consistently on long-term projects, the solution might be the use of a work-progress journal. The concept is simple. The human ego is a powerful force, and for a student trying to stay on top of big assignments, a little ego can be used to help keep you on track. Allow me to explain. You should buy a small spiral notebook that you store in your top desk drawer. Every night, follow the very simple habit of jotting down the day's date, the long-term work you had scheduled for the day, and the work that you actually accomplished. These entries should be very brief, no more than a line each. The idea is that the actual act of keeping the journal is very easy, so you should have no problem making it an unbreakable habit.

This lack of confidence, coupled with a lack of first-person exposure to the most important material in your class, is going to lead to poor academic performance, and this will cause your confidence to spiral even lower.
                

Page: 144
> Set arbitrary deadlines. This technique is simple in concept and surprisingly effective in practice. When you have a long-term project to work on, establish from the outset several nonnegotiable intermediate deadlines. Nothing is actually due on these deadlines, but they will exist as a nearby landmark to help you focus on near-term goals. The positive effect is powerful. Imagine the mental difference between having a paper due in three weeks, and having three days to solidify a thesis statement. Or imagine the difference between having a month to finish a big computer science programming project and having five days to build the user interface component. The former is daunting and invites procrastination, the latter is approachable and motivating.

> But don't just volunteer, volunteer quietly. If you want to really derive the full personal benefit from your community service work, don't talk about it much.

> One good way to remember to focus on form as well as content is to approach every paper as if you were trying to win a Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting. This prize is given each year to a work that “illuminates a significant and complex subject, demonstrating mastery of the subject, lucid writing and clear presentation.” If you have any doubt as to what it means to illuminate a complex subject with lucid writing and clear presentation, go to www.pulitzer.org and read the recent winners in this category. These articles typically move deftly from anecdote, to question, to theory, then back again, pulling you deep into the core issues surrounding the issue at hand. They do this without ever getting bogged down in an overabundance of details or an oppressively didactic tone. This should be your model.

> Finally, if there are any particular projects or talents that play a major role in your life, summer can be a great time to develop them. The key is to work such a personal pursuit into an official structure that includes accountability. If you want to spend the summer writing, do so with the goal of submitting works to three different competitions come fall. If you want to polish a musical talent, join a performance group, book some gigs, or organize a program to teach music to local kids. If you are a skilled computer programmer, work on contributing a clever piece of computer code to an Open Source project.

And once you begin exploring many routes, combine the approaches that seem successful, discard the attempts that fail, and constantly take the time to reevaluate what new opportunities may have just become recently available.

> You are confident, your future is secure, but you are curious about what this person does and why. This is the sole reason why you are talking to that visiting journalist, CEO, or research scientist. You ask insightful questions that show a solid understanding of the contact's work and a desire on your part to become more knowledgeable. You never once offer up elements of your résumé unless specifically asked, and even then, you do so with restraint. You show consideration and respect. You are confident without coming across like a used-car salesman. Not once do you show even a hint of underlying self-interest. In fact, you might even forget to give your name, leaving the contact to ask you as you walk away. This is antinetworking, and it works. Pleasantly surprised, the person you are talking to will drop their defenses, and, in the best of circumstances, remember the engaging student whose palpable enthusiasm and knowledge of the topic impressed them.

> However, there is another twist. For your most serious, arduous, and important studying tasks, it's sometimes not enough to just cruise to any old spot in the library. You need to find your own secret study space. A location that you know will almost always be available; a monastic corner where silence is complete, Zenlike concentration a given, and all distractions are deflected. The more unusual or unconventional the location the better. For me, my secret study space was a little-used carrel at the end of a dimly lit, nonwindowed book aisle on a random unfurnished floor of the biomedical library
                

Page: 173
> The key to making the most out of your secret study space is to use it sparingly. Over time, it becomes depressing to study in such isolation. If you insist on completing every reading assignment, problem set, and short paper in this seclusion, you will soon feel quite lonely.

> Take, for example, a political science exam where you will be given essay questions on various theoretical frameworks. As you move through your elaborate study system, begin to draw up a quiz for each theory. The quiz can have basic questions about who was responsible for each theory, when it was published, and what topics it involves. If you covered four major arguments against a particular theory, put down a question along the lines of: “List the four major arguments against Theory X, who is responsible for each, and what flaw they described.” Your final study goal is to ace these quizzes without peeking at your notes. Once you can do that, you are ready for the exam.

> Take as another example a computer science exam for a class about operating systems. You know your exam will cover both applied questions, where you use techniques learned in class to solve a new problem, and straightforward factual questions. Your study quiz could then consist of questions dealing with all the major fact-based topics, as well as an example problem to solve for each of the major applied techniques you might have to use. Again, once you can ace these quizzes, you are ready to go.

> This approach turns studying into a two-step process. The first step is the long and silent review of all the material that is going to be on the test. While you do this review, jot down your recall questions. If you ask about a topic from a specific book, jot down the page number where the answer can be found. If you ask about something from your notes, jot down the date of the relevant lecture. This will save a lot of time when you forget an answer later on. The next step of the process is the quizzing. This is where the real learning actually happens. When quizzing yourself, you don't necessarily have to write down your answers. This might be necessary for solving math problems, but for discussion-style questions, feel free to formulate your response out loud. You can cover topics much quicker when you just have to talk as opposed to write. However, if speaking out loud, it's important that you still use complete sentences. The more clearly you articulate your thoughts, the more clearly you remember the information.

> In fact, this technique saves you time and provides peace of mind. Your goal for studying is no longer an amorphous promise to “review all the relevant material”; instead, it's the much more specific “review all the relevant material until I can ace all my quizzes.”

> To be a successful student, you must abandon the start-slow, end-fast mind-set, and instead approach all projects by aiming to start fast, end slow. It's a subtle variation, but it makes a big difference. Take, for example, a funding proposal for a club you run. If you have two weeks to finish it, plan to have most of it done by the end of the first week. The day before you leave for spring vacation, do your packing in the morning, not late at night. If you have a big class presentation to research, complete the work with days to spare. No matter how big or how small the assignment, get in the habit of starting fast and ending slow. if you make a point of getting as much accomplished as early as possible, your life will be significantly less frantic. This is a fundamental shift in how most students approach their work, but if you give it a try, you will become much more successful.

> To not have “no regrets” is to approach life with a sense of excitement and possibility. It's to be happy about your opportunities, not your successes.
