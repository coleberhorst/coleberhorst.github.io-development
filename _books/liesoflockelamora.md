> AN OLD Camorri proverb has it that the only constant in the soul of man is inconstancy; anything and everything else can pass out of fashion—even something as utilitarian as a hill stuffed full of corpses.

> “Gods!” Doña Sofia stared at the spreading stain on the water; the surviving fighters stood with their heads lowered, and the priests were gesturing some sort of mutual blessing. “Unbelievable! Taken in so fast, by such a simple trick. Well, my father used to say that one moment of misjudgment at the Revel is worth ten at any other time.” Locke bowed deeply to her, taking one hand and kissing it. “I doubt him not at all, Doña Sofia. Not at all.” Smiling amiably, he bowed to her once more, then turned to shake hands with her husband.

> “My boy,” said Chains, “my intermittently brilliant little boy, your world has such small horizons. You can see clearly enough to pull a fast one on someone, but you can’t see past the immediate consequences. Until you learn to think ahead of the repercussions, you are putting yourself and everyone around you in danger. You can’t help being young, but it’s past time that you stopped being stupid. So listen carefully. “Your first mistake

> The Last Mistake was a sort of monument to the failure of human artifice at critical moments. Its walls were covered in a bewildering variety of souvenirs, each one telling a visual tale that ended with the phrase “not quite good enough.” Above the bar was a full suit of armor, a square hole punched through at the left breast by a crossbow quarrel. Broken swords and split helmets covered the walls, along with fragments of oars, masts, spars, and tatters of sails. One of the bar’s proudest claims was that it had secured a memento of every ship that had foundered within sight of Camorr in the past seventy years.

> drizzle when they emerged from Harza’s shop, giggling to themselves. “Chains used to claim that there’s no freedom quite like the freedom of being constantly underestimated,” said Locke.

> Oh-ho, thought Locke. Much better. The more in control the mark thinks they are, the more easily they respond to real control. Another one of Father Chains’ old maxims, proven in Locke’s experience too many times to count.

> “When you don’t know everything you could know, it’s a fine time to shut your fucking noisemaker and be polite.”

> “I had this talk with Calo and Galdo and Sabetha last year,” he began. “You boys are investments, in time and treasure both.” He exhaled ragged crescents of pale smoke, failing as usual to conjure full rings. “Big investments. My life’s work, maybe. A pair of brat masterpieces. So I want you to remember that you can’t always smile your way around a fight. If someone pulls steel on you, I expect you to survive. Sometimes that means giving back in kind. Sometimes it means running like your ass is on fire. Always it means knowing which is the right choice—and that’s why we’ve got to talk about your inclinations.”

> “Yes. Up here in this garden, it won’t matter who your parents were; I’ll make you work until you sweat blood and plead for mercy. I’ll thrash on you until you’re inventing new gods to pray to. The only thing this garden respects is concentration. Can you concentrate, every moment you’re up here? Can you distill your attention, drive it down to the narrowest focus, live absolutely in the now, and shut out all other concerns?”

Time had narrowed Angiavesta Vorchenza. She was not so much withered as collapsed, a spindly living caricature like a wooden idol animated by the sorcery of sheer willpower.

> “Your time here in Revelation House will bring you close to Death the Transition on many occasions, and it is a certainty that some of you will pass beyond before you finish your initiation. This may be achieved through inattentiveness, lassitude, ill fortune, or the inscrutable will of the Lady Most Kind herself. As initiates of the Lady, you will be exposed to Death the Transition and its consequences for the rest of your lives. You must grow accustomed to it. It is natural for living flesh to recoil from the presence of death, and from thoughts of death. Your discipline must overcome what is natural.”

## Summary
Locke’s growing up lessons are cut with a present day plot. Each section seems to tie very nicely to what follows or precedes. Additionally there is quite a bit of brutal imagery side by side with Locke’s negotiations. The author does a very good job of showing the customs of the time and evoking a sense of poverty / dirty environment.

Locke unwittingly gets involved in a power struggle between capas while making large scores on nobles. In the end he develops quite a refined sense of duty, honor, and place compared to his younger self. The author does a very good job of showing some things that change and don’t in his personality. Further, Locke is never perfect and often has to make the best of world he lives in and his mistakes. Locke is sarcastic, passionate, loyal, physically weak, overconfident.

## Things to Remember
The rituals of his gang / belief in 13th god start to teach him morality, interestingly not from the state or from a true religion.
Locke becomes familial with Chains and his gang. Sharing dinners which are eloquently described.
the moral lessons of the teachers in the books are amazing as are their teaching methods (Capa Barsavi, Don who teaches fighting, Chains among others). There is a smattering of almost every philosophy even a kind of crazed stoicism in the death priests. The various outlooks on life the gang samples show an ability to make your own right and wrong and how to construct that without being morally ambivalent.
The constructed economy and sense of craft / quality is everywhere throughout the book. The author is definitely trying to instil a sense of craftsmanship and love of quality when he describes various tradesmen and various buildings in detail. (cooking, architecture, alchemy, swordsmanship)
The constant danger of thinking you have laid a perfect plan. The arrogant planners of the book often encounter too many wrinkles and have to either adapt or sink in their own circumstances. This attitude could be applied to the moral lessons above.

## Big Ideas
Adapting and building your own life’s purpose can be achieved with adaptiveness, openness to others’ ideas, and something important to anchor yourself upon. Those that fail to adapt and examine their purpose and principles have that be their doom.

## Info
More in commonplace book quotes particularly samples of good prose and imagery.
