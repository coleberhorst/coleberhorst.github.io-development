Welcome! I am Cole Berhorst, an American software engineer and avid reader. Below is a bit about what I'm up to now.

**School and Job**

Computer Science student. No longer accepting longer term freelance work for the forseeable future. Looking for part to full time work with flexible hours to pay for expenses in school.


**Health**

Improving my diet: my current plan is around a 400 calorie deficit from food. Additionally, I am getting ~500 calories of exercise daily usually from walking or [bodyweight strength training]("https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine"). Starting to enjoy fitness programming and developing a good range of meals to cook. 


**Minimalism**

Exploring some aspects of minimalism and trying to find what works for me and what doesn't. I've reduced what I own and donated a lot!
